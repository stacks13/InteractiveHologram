Holograms have been a dream of tech and entertainment companies as well as consumers ever since a long time. The real hologram can be seen without the aid of any special lenses,screens or props. But there are holographic images produced by means of lenses to create stage illusions like Pepper’s Ghost which are not true holograms, they are called holographic illusions. We will be using Pepper’s Ghost Pyramid to create our holographic illusion.

The DIY hologram pyramid is a simple device that can be made by manipulating a sheet of plastic into the shape of a pyramid with its top cut off. The device creates a 3D-like illusion for the viewer and makes an image or video appear as if it were in midair.

### Objective

The objective of the project is to make use of the key points of the hand generated by the **SRHandNET** model to create a new model which will recognise the hand gestures from the key points. Using these gestures we will assign different actions to the which will be used to manipulate the 3D objects in our hologram.
